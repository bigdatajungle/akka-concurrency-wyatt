Worked though the examples in the pre-print of Derek Wyatt's book, Akka Concurrency. I found a lot bugs were while working through the book, and I sometimes had to pick an arbitrary implementation for things where code was unexpectedly not provided or wouldn't compile. From what I've heard, the released edition didn't fix many or most of the bugs, so the code probably won't differ from the print version by much.
